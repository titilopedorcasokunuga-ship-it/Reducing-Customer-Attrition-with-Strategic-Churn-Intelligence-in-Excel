# Business Introduction

TeleConnect operates in a highly competitive telecommunications market where customer acquisition costs are significantly higher than customer retention costs. Sustained profitability depends heavily on reducing customer churn and increasing customer lifetime value (CLV).

In subscription-based telecom models, churn directly impacts:
- Revenue stability
- Operational forecasting
- Marketing spend efficiency
- Brand equity

This project analyzes customer churn behavior using Microsoft Excel and presents a structured dashboard designed for executive-level decision-making.

---

# Problem Statement

TeleConnect has experienced consistent customer attrition, impacting recurring revenue and profitability. However, the organization lacked:

- Clear visibility into churn drivers
- Segmented churn analysis by customer attributes
- Data-backed retention strategies
- Executive-ready reporting for strategic action

The business problem addressed in this project:

> **Identify the key drivers of customer churn and provide actionable, measurable recommendations to reduce churn rate and improve retention.**

---

# Project Overview

This project was developed entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, leveraging:

- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- Advanced Excel Formulas
- Interactive Dashboard Design
- Slicers for dynamic filtering

The dashboard provides a multi-dimensional churn analysis covering:

- Contract type
- Technical support
- Payment methods
- Customer satisfaction
- Customer service call frequency

The goal was to convert raw operational data into executive-level business intelligence.

# Dashboard Analysis & Insights

![Customer Churn Dashboard](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ynQ8to2HyeUo5oyzfFR02SOgYrv1g0C4)
---

## 1. Overall Customer Churn

- **Total Customers Retained:** 81.3%
- **Total Customers Churned:** 18.7%

### Insight

An 18.7% churn rate in telecom is considered materially high and signals structural retention issues.

If sustained annually, this churn rate significantly erodes revenue and increases dependency on costly acquisition campaigns.

### Business Risk

- High customer acquisition cost (CAC) replacement
- Revenue volatility
- Increased pressure on marketing budgets

---

## 2. Churn by Contract Type

| Contract Type   | Churn Rate |
|-----------------|------------|
| Month-to-Month  | 51.67%     |
| One-Year        | 18.93%     |
| Two-Year        | 10.73%     |

### Insight

Customers on **month-to-month contracts churn at a dramatically higher rate (51.67%)** compared to long-term contracts.

This indicates:
- Low switching barriers
- Lack of contractual commitment
- Potential dissatisfaction or price sensitivity

### Business Interpretation

Long-term contracts create behavioral lock-in and revenue predictability. Month-to-month customers represent the highest churn risk segment.

---

## 3. Technical Support Impact on Churn

| Technical Support | Retention Rate | Churn Rate |
|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| No Support        | 74.64%        | 25.36%     |
| With Support      | 85.32%        | 14.68%     |

### Insight

Customers without technical support are nearly **2x more likely to churn**.

### Business Interpretation

Access to support:
- Increases perceived service value
- Reduces frustration
- Improves trust
- Enhances customer experience

Technical support is not a cost center — it is a retention driver.

---

## 4. Payment Method vs Churn

Observations:

- **Electronic Check users show highest churn**
- Bank transfer and credit card users show comparatively lower churn

### Insight

Electronic check users may:
- Be less digitally integrated
- Have lower service commitment
- Represent price-sensitive segments

### Business Interpretation

Auto-payment methods correlate with lower churn due to:
- Reduced payment friction
- Increased customer inertia
- Behavioral continuity

---

## 5. Customer Satisfaction vs Churn

Churn decreases significantly as satisfaction score increases.

Low satisfaction customers show disproportionate churn volume.

### Insight

Customer satisfaction is a leading indicator of churn.

Customers rating satisfaction low are high-risk and require proactive intervention.

### Business Interpretation

Customer experience directly drives retention. Satisfaction scoring should be integrated into churn prediction modeling.

---

## 6. Customer Service Calls vs Churn

Customers with higher numbers of service calls show increased churn probability.

Notably:
- Customers with 4+ calls show materially higher churn rates.

### Insight

Frequent service calls indicate unresolved issues and poor first-call resolution performance.

### Business Interpretation

Call frequency is a churn predictor.

Operational inefficiency in issue resolution increases churn risk.

---

# Strategic Recommendations

Based on analysis, the following strategic initiatives are recommended:

---

## 1️⃣ Transition Month-to-Month Customers to Long-Term Contracts

- Offer pricing incentives for 1-year/2-year contracts
- Bundle streaming or data benefits
- Introduce loyalty rewards

**Target Segment:** Month-to-month subscribers

---

## 2️⃣ Bundle Technical Support as a Value-Add

- Offer free technical support for first 3 months
- Promote support adoption
- Highlight support benefits during onboarding

---

## 3️⃣ Incentivize Auto-Payment Migration

- Offer billing discounts for auto-pay
- Simplify bank/credit card enrollment
- Phase out electronic check incentives

---

## 4️⃣ Proactive Intervention for Low Satisfaction Customers

- Deploy early-warning churn flags
- Offer service recovery discounts
- Implement follow-up engagement strategy

---

## 5️⃣ Improve First-Call Resolution Rate

- Enhance agent training
- Implement ticket tracking analytics
- Identify repeat complaint root causes

---

# Projected Measurable Business Impact

If the following improvements are achieved:

### Scenario Modeling

If churn reduces from **18.7% → 14%** (4.7% reduction):

Assuming:
- 10,000 customers
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) = $70/month

### Annual Revenue Retained:

4.7% of 10,000 = 470 customers saved

470 × $70 × 12 = **$394,800 annual retained revenue**

This excludes:
- Reduced acquisition costs
- Increased customer lifetime value
- Improved operational efficiency

---
